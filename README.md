RUN THE FIRST PERSON SCENE:
Currently multiple issues including a hard crash seemingly randomly but consistently occuring as well as a glitch with the swat model's animation where for a single frame or so the scale is gigantic and fills the screen creating what looks like a weird "dark flash".  Compass is also only semi-functional and inaccurate.
